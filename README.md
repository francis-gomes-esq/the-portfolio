## Unit 2 Challenge: Portfolio

In my second endeavour on the GitHub repository, I regretfully fell short of meeting all the specified acceptance criteria. It is crucial to note that this outcome does not stem from a lack of effort on my part; rather, I faced a combination of technical challenges and health issues during the process. Despite these setbacks, I am fully committed to a thorough iteration on this task, ensuring it not only overcomes the encountered hurdles but also reaches and surpasses the required standard.

### User Story

```
N/A
```

### Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

-   When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
-   When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
-   When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
-   When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
-   When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
-   When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

Please note: The acceptance criteria haven't been fully met due to some technical challenges and time pressure. This will be rectified in future updates.
